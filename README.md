# OverlapEllipse:
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to problem solve before implementing code.

# Problem:
Write code that prints the area overlap between two ellipses using Monte Carlo simulation.

# Description of Files:
- Structure Chart developed before writing code of how each function will interact with eachother to produce simulation
- Code file titled A4_3.py
